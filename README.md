Problems to being solved:

People of old age or disabilities have difficulties to visit hospitals  and are unable to track their health records

We get frantic and unsure of what to do in situations involving medical emergencies.As a result, we provide a solution to the urgent situation in which you can simply input the issue and the pertinent information will be delivered.


Solution to Problem implemented in the System:

Disease Information: The chat bot feature can provide detailed information about various diseases, their causes, symptoms, and treatment options. Users can enter their symptoms, and the chatbot can suggest possible diagnoses, and provide general information on how to manage the condition.

Medication Information: The chat bot feature can also provide information on prescription medications, including the dosage, side effects, and potential interactions with other drugs. Users can enter the name of the medication they are taking, and the chat bot can provide detailed information about it.

Doctor Consultation: The chatbot can also provide users with information on nearby doctors and healthcare providers, their contact information, and their specialties. This can help users easily find and schedule appointments with doctors who can provide appropriate treatment for their conditions.

Personalized Recommendations: The chat bot can use machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations based on a user's medical history, symptoms, and lifestyle. For example, it can suggest specific medications or lifestyle changes that may be helpful in managing a particular condition
